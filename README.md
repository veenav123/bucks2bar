This is the documentation for the bucks2bar project.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `css/styles.css`: This file is used to define custom styles for the HTML elements in the project.
- `js/scripts.js`: This file is used to write custom JavaScript code for the project.
- `index.html`: This file is the main HTML file of the project. It contains the structure and content of the web page.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project. It can be used to provide information about the project and its usage.

## Adding Bootstrap

To include the latest version of Bootstrap in your project, you can add the following code to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

This code will include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files from the Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) in your project. You can then use Bootstrap classes and components in your HTML code to style and enhance your web page.
```

Note: The file is intentionally left blank.
